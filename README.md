# GitSizeViewer

 

Python script to view the size of a github repository, along with other useful information. This uses the requests and regex module to parse an input repository's URL, obtain the JSON for the respective repository using the Github API, parse the JSON, and display useful information about the Github repository. 





## How to run



If you haven't already, install the requests module using:

```
pip install requests
```

or

```
pip install -r requrements.txt
```



Download gitinfo.py, and execute the file in Python. Input the Github repository's URL, and the repository's name, owner's name, description, whether it is forked or not, size, and programming language will be displayed.





## Future plans





- Add a GUI
- Add support for more detailed information
- Implement on the web
